# Module 1: Docker & Terraform

## 📘 Data Engineering Bootcamp – Module 1 (DataTalks.Club)

In this module, I learned the fundamentals of data engineering by setting up a complete local development environment and working with real-world data.

I configured my environment using Docker and Docker Compose to run PostgreSQL and Python services in isolated containers. Using the NYC Taxi dataset, I practiced loading large datasets into a Postgres database and managing tables efficiently.

I connected Python to PostgreSQL using Pandas and SQLAlchemy, which allowed me to ingest, transform, and explore the data. I also learned how to inspect database schemas and validate data using tools like `to_sql()` and `get_schema()`.

Throughout this module, I used Git and GitHub for version control to track my progress and manage changes in my projects. This helped me maintain organized and reproducible workflows.

By completing Module 1, I developed the ability to:

- Build and manage a Docker-based data engineering environment  
- Configure and work with PostgreSQL databases  
- Ingest and process large datasets (NYC Taxi data)  
- Connect Python applications to databases using Pandas and SQLAlchemy  
- Explore schemas and validate data structures  
- Use Git and GitHub for version control  

This module gave me a strong foundation for building scalable and reliable data pipelines and prepared me for more advanced topics in the DataTalks.Club Data Engineering Bootcamp.
